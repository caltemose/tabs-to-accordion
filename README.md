# Tabs to Accordion Component

A tabs (larger screens) to accordion (smaller screens) reusable component.

Based on/influenced by this CodePen: https://codepen.io/mpiotrowicz/pen/gocmu


## Current Status

The repo currently has a running example with the mostly unmodified code from the above CodePen to use as reference while building a new version that meets with the goals listed below.


## Goals for Refactoring

- ES6 syntax
- Ditch jQuery dependency
- No template embedded in the Javascript
- Options for extra tab markup (for larger screens) to be generated by build-process or client-side
- More config data passed through constructor/options
- CSS updated to follow SuitCSS (probably)
- Improved accessibility
- WCAG 2.0 compliant (not sure what level yet)
