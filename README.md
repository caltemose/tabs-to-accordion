# Tabs to Accordion Component

A tabs (larger screens) to accordion (smaller screens) reusable component.

Based on/influenced by this CodePen: https://codepen.io/mpiotrowicz/pen/gocmu


## Current Status

The repo currently has a running example with the mostly unmodified code from the above CodePen I used as reference while building the refactored version that meets with the goals listed below.

Current version of the code can be seen here:
[https://caltemose.github.io/tabs-to-accordion/](https://caltemose.github.io/tabs-to-accordion/)

Currently the code can use some refactoring for the sake of DRY in addition to the unmet goals below.

## Goals for Refactoring

- ~~ES6 syntax~~
- ~~Ditch jQuery dependency~~
- ~~No template embedded in the Javascript~~
- ~~CSS updated to follow SuitCSS (probably)~~
- WCAG 2.0 compliant (not sure what level yet)
- Use module builder instead of attaching to window

## Possible Improvements

- More config data passed through constructor/options
- Options for extra tab markup (for larger screens) to be generated by build-process or client-side
