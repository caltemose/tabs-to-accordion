# Tabs to Accordion Component

A tabs (larger screens) to accordion (smaller screens) reusable component.

Based on/influenced by this CodePen: https://codepen.io/mpiotrowicz/pen/gocmu

## Current Status

Currently implementing the feature to allow the accordion sections to close without opening a new section.
This works but if you cross the small-to-large breakpoint (768px) tab content will be hidden on larger screens which is undesirable.


## Notes

The repo currently has a running example with the mostly unmodified code from the above CodePen I used as reference while building the refactored version that meets with the goals listed below.

Current version of the code can be seen here:
[https://caltemose.github.io/tabs-to-accordion/](https://caltemose.github.io/tabs-to-accordion/)

Currently the code can use some refactoring for the sake of DRY in addition to the unmet goals below.

## Goals for Refactoring

- ~~ES6 syntax~~
- ~~Ditch jQuery dependency~~
- ~~No template embedded in the Javascript~~
- ~~CSS updated to follow SuitCSS (probably)~~
- WCAG 2.0 compliant (not sure what level yet)
- Use module builder instead of attaching to window
- Expanded content can be closed when current tab/title is clicked/touched (in-progress, see Current Status above regarding bug/issue)
- Add a class to selected tab nav &lt;li&gt; elements so they can be styled according to state (this will allow the border to be on the &lt;li&gt; in the cases where it might be desirable to hide the bottom border on selected tab buttons)

## Possible Improvements

- More config data passed through constructor/options (scroll on/off and amount, etc)
- Options for extra tab markup (for larger screens) to be generated by build-process or client-side
- Intelligent way to handle page wiggling on larger screens when tab content areas have diverse heights ([this is not pretty but the most likely solution at the moment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19172545/how-to-get-hidden-element-height))
